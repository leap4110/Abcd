Ah, I understand now! You want to exclude ALL payments from providers that have ANY CBCC payment. Here's how to modify your expression:

## Method 1: Using Set Analysis (Most Efficient)
```
=Sum({<ProviderID -= {"=Sum(If(SUPPCATCD='CBCC', 1, 0)) > 0"}>} PaymentAmount)
```

## Method 2: Using If Statement with Aggr()
```
=Sum(If(Aggr(Sum(If(SUPPCATCD='CBCC', 1, 0)), ProviderID) = 0, PaymentAmount))
```

## Method 3: Alternative Set Analysis
```
=Sum({<ProviderID -= {">=$(=Min(If(SUPPCATCD='CBCC', ProviderID)))"}>} PaymentAmount)
```

## Method 4: Using NOT EXISTS
```
=Sum(If(NOT Exists(ProviderID & '|CBCC', ProviderID & '|' & If(SUPPCATCD='CBCC', 'CBCC')), PaymentAmount))
```

## Most Recommended:
Method 1 is usually the most efficient. Just replace:
- `ProviderID` with your actual provider field name
- `PaymentAmount` with your actual payment field name

The logic is: "Sum all payments, but exclude any provider that has at least one CBCC payment."

What are the actual field names for your provider identifier and payment amount?
