Here's the complete PROC SQL conversion of both part_a and part_b:

**Part A - PROC SQL equivalent:**
```sql
PROC SQL;
CREATE TABLE part_b AS
SELECT PRSNWITHDSBLTYID,
       PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
       SERVICE_TYPE,
       SUM(PYMTAMT) AS PYMTAMT
FROM part_a
GROUP BY PRSNWITHDSBLTYID, PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, SERVICE_TYPE;
QUIT;
```

**Part B - PROC SQL equivalent with unique participants:**
```sql
PROC SQL;
CREATE TABLE &OUTPUT. AS
SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
       DELIVERY_ABN_STS,
       SERVICE_TYPE,
       COUNT(DISTINCT PRSNWITHDSBLTYID) AS PARTICIPANTS_&OUTPUT.,
       SUM(PYMTAMT) AS PYMTAMT_&OUTPUT.
FROM part_a
GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, DELIVERY_ABN_STS, SERVICE_TYPE;
QUIT;
```

**Key differences from original PROC SUMMARY:**
1. **Part A**: Keeps all grouping variables in output (vs dropping _TYPE_ and _FREQ_)
2. **Part B**: Uses `COUNT(DISTINCT PRSNWITHDSBLTYID)` to get true unique participants instead of just record frequency
3. **Both**: More explicit about what columns are created and kept
4. **Macro variables**: Uses `&OUTPUT.` just like the original code

If you want to exactly replicate the original dropping behavior in Part A:
```sql
PROC SQL;
CREATE TABLE part_b AS
SELECT SUM(PYMTAMT) AS PYMTAMT
FROM part_a
GROUP BY PRSNWITHDSBLTYID, PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, SERVICE_TYPE;
QUIT;
```

But typically you'd want to keep the grouping variables for context.
