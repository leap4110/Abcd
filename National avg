Good catch! Yes, if you have other filter panes (like state, region, category, etc.), the current expression **would** reflect those selections, which you don't want.

To make it truly **only relative to time**, you need to explicitly ignore all other fields except your time field. Here's the corrected approach:

**Option 1: If your time field is called `QUARTER` or `DATE_FIELD`:**
```
=COUNT(DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY) / 
 COUNT({<ABN_LEGAL_NM, STATE, REGION, CATEGORY>} TOTAL DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY)
```

**Option 2: More robust - ignore everything except time:**
```
=COUNT(DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY) / 
 COUNT({1<[YOUR_TIME_FIELD]=$::[YOUR_TIME_FIELD]>} TOTAL DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY)
```

**Option 3: If you know all your filter fields, list them explicitly:**
```
=COUNT(DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY) / 
 COUNT({<ABN_LEGAL_NM, STATE, REGION, CATEGORY, INDUSTRY>} TOTAL DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY)
```

**What I'd recommend:**
Tell me what your time field is called, and I'll give you the exact syntax. The key principle is:
- **Numerator:** Respects all current selections (including time)
- **Denominator:** Ignores all selections EXCEPT time selections

This way your national average is truly "national for the selected time period" regardless of what other filters users apply.

What's your time field name, and what other filter panes do you have?
