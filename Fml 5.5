Right! The issue is that `MaxString(QTR)` ignores your filter selections and always returns the absolute maximum quarter in the dataset. You need the expression to be dynamic to your filter.

## Dynamic Solution - Respect Filter Selections

**Replace this:**
```qlik
Count(DISTINCT {<QTR = {"$(=MaxString(QTR))"}>} PARTICIPANT_KEY)
```

**With this:**
```qlik
Count(DISTINCT {<QTR = {"$(=Max(QTR))"}>} PARTICIPANT_KEY)
```

The difference:
- `MaxString(QTR)` = Absolute maximum across ALL data (ignores filters)
- `Max(QTR)` = Maximum within current filter context (respects selections)

## Alternative Approach - Most Recent Per Participant

If you want each participant counted only once using their most recent quarter within the selected time period:

```qlik
Count(DISTINCT Aggr(
    If(QTR = Max(TOTAL <PARTICIPANT_KEY> QTR), PARTICIPANT_KEY), 
    PARTICIPANT_KEY
))
```

## Test It

With `Max(QTR)` in your expression:
- When you select "December 2024", it should count participants from December 2024
- When no filter is applied, it should count participants from March 2025 (the overall maximum)

Try the first solution with `Max(QTR)` - this should make your count dynamic to the quarter filter selections.
