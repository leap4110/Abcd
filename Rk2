Based on your data model, here's the expression for your filter pane to show top 5% of providers by payment amount:

## **Filter Pane Expression:**

```qlik
=If(
    Rank(Aggr(Sum(PYMTAMT), ABN_LEGAL_NM)) <= 
    Ceil(Count(DISTINCT ABN_LEGAL_NM) * 0.05),
    ABN_LEGAL_NM
)
```

## **Alternative Method (if the above doesn't work):**

```qlik
=If(
    ABN_LEGAL_NM = Aggr(
        If(Rank(Sum({<ABN_LEGAL_NM>} PYMTAMT)) <= 
           Ceil(Count(DISTINCT {<ABN_LEGAL_NM>} ABN_LEGAL_NM) * 0.05), 
           ABN_LEGAL_NM), 
        ABN_LEGAL_NM
    ),
    ABN_LEGAL_NM
)
```

## **Script-based Solution (Better Performance):**

Add this to your load script after your existing tables:

```qlik
Top5ProviderFlag:
LOAD 
    ABN_LEGAL_NM,
    If(ProviderRank <= Ceil(TotalProviders * 0.05), 'Top 5%', 'Others') as Top5PercentFlag
;
LOAD 
    ABN_LEGAL_NM,
    Rank(TotalPayments, 4) as ProviderRank,
    Count(DISTINCT ABN_LEGAL_NM) OVER() as TotalProviders
;
LOAD 
    ABN_LEGAL_NM,
    Sum(PYMTAMT) as TotalPayments
RESIDENT Dim_Payment
WHERE Len(ABN_LEGAL_NM) > 0
GROUP BY ABN_LEGAL_NM;
```

Then in your filter pane, just use `Top5PercentFlag` as the dimension.

**The script method is recommended** because it will perform better and you can simply use the `Top5PercentFlag` field in your filter pane instead of a complex calculated dimension.

Since your tables are linked by `PROVIDER_KEY`, the association should work automatically in Qlik's data model.
