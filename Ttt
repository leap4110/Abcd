Here are the two expressions you need:

**Main expression (with text):**
```
=ALT(COUNT(DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY), 0) & ' is out of ' & COUNT({1} TOTAL DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY) & ' participants'
```

**Separate expression for total participants:**
```
=COUNT({1} TOTAL DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY)
```

The key parts:
- `COUNT(DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY)` - your current count in the selection context
- `COUNT({1} TOTAL DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY)` - total participants ignoring all selections
- `{1}` - set analysis that ignores all user selections
- `TOTAL` - ensures the calculation is done across all data
- `& ' is out of ' &` - concatenates the text between the numbers

This will display something like: "25 is out of 150 participants"

If you want the total to respect certain selections but ignore others, you can modify the set analysis. For example, to ignore only ABN_LEGAL_NM selections:
```
=ALT(COUNT(DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY), 0) & ' is out of ' & COUNT({<ABN_LEGAL_NM>} TOTAL DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY) & ' participants'
```
