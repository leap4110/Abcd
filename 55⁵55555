Here's the SAS code to select one record per ABN with the earliest DATE_QUARTER:

**Using PROC SORT and DATA Step:**
```sas
/* Sort by ABN and DATE_QUARTER */
proc sort data=your_dataset;
    by ABN DATE_QUARTER;
run;

/* Keep only the first record for each ABN */
data result;
    set your_dataset;
    by ABN;
    if first.ABN;
run;
```

**Alternative using PROC SQL with GROUP BY:**
```sas
proc sql;
    create table result as
    select ABN,
           LEGAL_NM,
           PRVDRSTS,
           MOTIFORPROFITIND,
           RGSTRTNSTSDESC,
           ABNPRMRYPRVRGHND,
           QTR,
           COUNT,
           min(DATE_QUARTER) as DATE_QUARTER
    from your_dataset
    group by ABN
    having DATE_QUARTER = min(DATE_QUARTER);
quit;
```

**Most Efficient Approach - PROC SORT + DATA Step:**
```sas
/* Sort the data first */
proc sort data=your_dataset out=sorted_data;
    by ABN DATE_QUARTER;
run;

/* Select first record for each ABN */
data final_result;
    set sorted_data;
    by ABN DATE_QUARTER;
    if first.ABN then output;
run;
```

The first approach is the most common and efficient in SAS. The `by ABN` statement with `first.ABN` will automatically select the first occurrence of each ABN value after the data is sorted by ABN and DATE_QUARTER.

Replace `your_dataset` with your actual dataset name, and `result` or `final_result` with whatever you want to name your output dataset.
