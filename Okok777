Ah, I understand now! You want the actual dates as column names, with PAYMENT and COUNT as the values. Here's the corrected code:

## Method: Transpose with Dates as Column Names
```sql
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE TRANSPOSED_DATA AS
    SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
           LEGALNM,
           DELIVERY_ABN_STS,
           Service_Type,
           EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE,
           LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS,
           
           /* Payment columns by date */
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2023'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30SEP2023,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2023'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_31DEC2023,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30MAR2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30JUN2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30SEP2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_31DEC2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2025'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30MAR2025,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2025'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30JUN2025,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC9999'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_31DEC9999,
           
           /* Count columns by date */
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2023'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30SEP2023,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2023'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_31DEC2023,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30MAR2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30JUN2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30SEP2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_31DEC2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2025'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30MAR2025,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2025'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30JUN2025,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC9999'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_31DEC9999,
           
           /* Total columns */
           SUM(PAYMENT) AS TOTAL_PAYMENT,
           SUM(COUNT) AS TOTAL_COUNT
           
    FROM FINAL_DATA
    GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, LEGALNM, DELIVERY_ABN_STS, Service_Type, 
             EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE, LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS
    ORDER BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, Service_Type;
QUIT;
```

## Sample Output Data:
```

  PAYMENT_31DEC2023: 0
  PAYMENT_30MAR2024: 0
  PAYMENT_30JUN2024: 0
  PAYMENT_30SEP2024: 100162.01
  PAYMENT_31DEC2024: 0
  PAYMENT_30MAR2025: 0
  PAYMENT_30JUN2025: 0
  PAYMENT_31DEC9999: 0
  COUNT_30SEP2023: 0
  COUNT_31DEC2023: 0
  COUNT_30MAR2024: 0
  COUNT_30JUN2024: 0
  COUNT_30SEP2024: 16
  COUNT_31DEC2024: 0
  COUNT_30MAR2025: 0
  COUNT_30JUN2025: 0
  COUNT_31DEC9999: 0
  TOTAL_PAYMENT: 100162.01
  TOTAL_COUNT: 16

Row 2:
  PMTRQSTPRVDRABN: 48164106311
  DELIVERY_ABN_STS: Unregistered
  Service_Type: Community Par.
  EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE: (missing)
  LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS: Unregistered
  PAYMENT_30SEP2023: 0
  PAYMENT_31DEC2023: 0
  PAYMENT_30MAR2024: 0
  PAYMENT_30JUN2024: 0
  PAYMENT_30SEP2024: 0
  PAYMENT_31DEC2024: 0
  PAYMENT_30MAR2025: 0
  PAYMENT_30JUN2025: 0
  PAYMENT_31DEC9999: 41275.62
  COUNT_30SEP2023: 0
  COUNT_31DEC2023: 0
  COUNT_30MAR2024: 0
  COUNT_30JUN2024: 0
  COUNT_30SEP2024: 0
  COUNT_31DEC2024: 0
  COUNT_30MAR2025: 0
  COUNT_30JUN2025: 0
  COUNT_31DEC9999: 8
  TOTAL_PAYMENT: 41275.62
  TOTAL_COUNT: 8
```

Now you have:
- **Date-based column names** (PAYMENT_30SEP2024, COUNT_30SEP2024, etc.)
- **PAYMENT values** in the payment columns
- **COUNT values** in the count columns
- **Timeseries view** where you can see payments and counts across different registration dates

This creates a proper timeseries matrix with dates as columns and payment/count metrics as the values!
