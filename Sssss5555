Here's the set analysis expression to get the top 10 providers by total payment amount in QlikSense:

```
{<provider = {"=Rank(Sum(payment)) <= 10"}>}
```

You would use this in a measure like:

```
Sum({<provider = {"=Rank(Sum(payment)) <= 10"}>} payment)
```

Or if you want to use it in a dimension to show only the top 10 providers:

```
=If(Rank(Sum(payment)) <= 10, provider)
```

The key parts:
- `Rank(Sum(payment))` calculates the rank based on total payment amounts
- `<= 10` limits it to the top 10
- The set analysis `{<provider = {"=..."}>}` filters the data to only include those top 10 providers

Note that this uses ascending rank by default (highest payments get rank 1). If you need descending rank, you can use `Rank(-Sum(payment))` instead.
