Yes, this makes perfect sense! You're experiencing the classic **double-counting problem**. 

**What's happening:**
- Total participants: 689,651
- Sum of disability breakdown: 7,342 + 19,868 + 24,617 + ... = much larger number
- This means participants are being counted multiple times in the disability breakdown

**The root cause:** Some participants appear in multiple disability categories, or they have multiple records with different disability classifications.

## Solutions to Fix the Double-Counting

**Option 1: Use Only() to Get One Disability Per Participant**
Change your disability breakdown expression to:
```qlik
Count(DISTINCT Aggr(Only(PARTICIPANT_KEY), PARTICIPANT_KEY, PRIMARY_DISABILITY))
```

**Option 2: Count Only the First/Most Recent Disability**
```qlik
Count(DISTINCT Aggr(
    If(PRIMARY_DISABILITY = FirstSortedValue(PRIMARY_DISABILITY, QTR, -1), PARTICIPANT_KEY), 
    PARTICIPANT_KEY
))
```

**Option 3: Debug - See Which Participants Have Multiple Disabilities**
Create a test table:
- **Dimension:** `PARTICIPANT_KEY`
- **Expression:** `Count(DISTINCT PRIMARY_DISABILITY)`

This will show you which participants (if any) have more than one disability type.

**Option 4: Simple Fix - Use the Same Logic for Both**
If your total uses `Count(DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY)`, make sure your breakdown uses the same participant-level aggregation.

Try Option 3 first to see if participants have multiple disability classifications. That will tell us which approach to use to fix the double-counting issue.
