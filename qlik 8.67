Perfect! Now I can see the problem. Your expression `QTR & ' - ' & PRIMARY_DISABILITY` is working and showing the data exists, but you're getting **one row per QTR-Disability combination** instead of one row per participant.

The issue is that you're **concatenating QTR with PRIMARY_DISABILITY as a single field**, which creates multiple rows per participant.

## The Fix

You need to **separate** these into different columns:

### Step 1: Change Your Table Structure

**Dimension:** 
```qlik
PARTICIPANT_KEY
```

**Column 1 - Most Recent QTR:**
```qlik
MaxString(QTR)
```

**Column 2 - Most Recent Primary Disability:**
```qlik
FirstSortedValue(PRIMARY_DISABILITY, QTR, -1)
```

### Step 2: Alternative Approach
If that still doesn't work, try this approach:

**Dimension:**
```qlik
PARTICIPANT_KEY
```

**Expression:**
```qlik
FirstSortedValue(PRIMARY_DISABILITY & ' (' & QTR & ')', QTR, -1)
```

This will show you the most recent disability with its quarter in parentheses.

### Step 3: Debug Version
To see all combinations per participant:

**Dimension:**
```qlik
PARTICIPANT_KEY  
```

**Expression:**
```qlik
Concat(DISTINCT QTR & '-' & PRIMARY_DISABILITY, ', ')
```

**The key insight from your screenshot:** Your data is structured correctly - you have QTR and PRIMARY_DISABILITY data. You just need to aggregate it properly by PARTICIPANT_KEY instead of showing every QTR-Disability combination as a separate row.

Try the approach in Step 1 first.
