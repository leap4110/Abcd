Looking at your SAS code, you're right to be concerned about performance with the `<>` (not equal) operators. Here are several more efficient approaches:

## **Option 1: Use Hash Tables (Most Efficient)**
```sas
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE TEMPORARY_TEST3 AS
    SELECT DISTINCT A.PRVDRABN
        , SUM(A.PYMTAMT) AS TOTAL_PAYMENT3
        , COUNT(DISTINCT A.PRSNWITHDSBSLTYID) AS COUNT2
        , B.FLAG
    FROM OUTPUT1.PAYMENTS_FINAL_&FLAG. AS A
        INNER JOIN TEMPORARY_TEST2 AS B
        ON A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = B.PRVDRABN
        AND A.PRSNWITHDSBSLTYID = B.PRSNWITHDSBSLTYID
    WHERE A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY A.PRVDRABN;
QUIT;
```

## **Option 2: Use EXISTS Subquery**
```sas
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE TEMPORARY_TEST3 AS
    SELECT DISTINCT A.PRVDRABN
        , SUM(A.PYMTAMT) AS TOTAL_PAYMENT3
        , COUNT(DISTINCT A.PRSNWITHDSBSLTYID) AS COUNT2
        , B.FLAG
    FROM OUTPUT1.PAYMENTS_FINAL_&FLAG. AS A
        LEFT JOIN TEMPORARY_TEST2 AS B
        ON A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = B.PRVDRABN
        AND A.PRSNWITHDSBSLTYID = B.PRSNWITHDSBSLTYID
    WHERE A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN IS NOT NULL
        AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM TEMPORARY_TEST2 T2
            WHERE T2.PRVDRABN = A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
                AND T2.PRSNWITHDSBSLTYID = A.PRSNWITHDSBSLTYID
        )
    GROUP BY A.PRVDRABN;
QUIT;
```

## **Option 3: Data Step with Hash (Best for Very Large Data)**
```sas
DATA TEMPORARY_TEST3;
    IF _N_ = 1 THEN DO;
        DECLARE HASH H(DATASET: "TEMPORARY_TEST2");
        H.DEFINEKEY("PRVDRABN", "PRSNWITHDSBSLTYID");
        H.DEFINEDATA("FLAG");
        H.DEFINEDONE();
    END;
    
    SET OUTPUT1.PAYMENTS_FINAL_&FLAG.;
    WHERE PMTRQSTPRVDRABN IS NOT NULL;
    
    IF H.FIND(KEY: PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, KEY: PRSNWITHDSBSLTYID) = 0 THEN DO;
        OUTPUT;
    END;
RUN;

PROC SUMMARY DATA=TEMPORARY_TEST3 NWAY;
    CLASS PRVDRABN FLAG;
    VAR PYMTAMT;
    OUTPUT OUT=TEMPORARY_TEST3_FINAL 
        SUM(PYMTAMT)=TOTAL_PAYMENT3
        N(PRSNWITHDSBSLTYID)=COUNT2;
RUN;
```

## **Key Performance Improvements:**

1. **Inner Join Instead of Left Join + WHERE**: The inner join naturally excludes non-matching records without needing `<>` comparisons
2. **Hash Tables**: For large datasets, hash lookups are much faster than repeated SQL comparisons
3. **Eliminated Redundant Logic**: The original code was essentially doing an inner join but using a more complex left join approach

## **Why This is Faster:**
- **No `<>` operators**: These require scanning and comparing every non-matching combination
- **Index-friendly joins**: Equality joins can use indexes effectively
- **Reduced I/O**: Inner joins process fewer records through the pipeline

The **Option 1 (Inner Join)** approach should give you the most immediate performance improvement with minimal code changes, while **Option 3 (Hash)** will be fastest for very large datasets.
