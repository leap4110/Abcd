I see the issue! The problem is that you have multiple records per participant (probably one record per ABN_LEGAL_NM per participant), so when you count distinct participants across all data, you're getting inflated numbers.

You need to use AGGR to ensure you're counting each participant only once. Here's the corrected expression:

**Main expression (with text):**
```
=ALT(COUNT(DISTINCT PARTICIPANT_KEY), 0) & ' is out of ' & COUNT({1} TOTAL AGGR(ONLY(PARTICIPANT_KEY), PARTICIPANT_KEY)) & ' participants'
```

**Separate expression for total participants:**
```
=COUNT({1} TOTAL AGGR(ONLY(PARTICIPANT_KEY), PARTICIPANT_KEY))
```

The key difference:
- `COUNT({1} TOTAL AGGR(ONLY(PARTICIPANT_KEY), PARTICIPANT_KEY))` creates a virtual table with one row per unique PARTICIPANT_KEY, then counts those rows
- This ensures each participant is counted only once, regardless of how many ABN_LEGAL_NM records they have

This should give you the correct total of 565 participants, and each row will show "X is out of 565 participants" where X is the count of distinct participants for that specific ABN_LEGAL_NM.

The AGGR approach handles the cardinality issue where participants might be associated with multiple ABN_LEGAL_NM values.
