Yes, if it's a cardinality issue (many-to-many relationships causing duplicate counting), here are expressions to handle it:

## Option 1: Using DISTINCT to Handle Cardinality
```
Sum(DISTINCT PYMTAMT)
```

## Option 2: Aggr with All Relevant Keys (Recommended)
```
Sum(Aggr(
    Sum(DISTINCT PYMTAMT), 
    PARTICIPANT_KEY, 
    PAYMENT_ID
))
```

## Option 3: Only() Function for 1-to-Many Relationships
```
Sum(Aggr(
    Only(PYMTAMT), 
    PAYMENT_ID
))
```

## Option 4: Handling Multiple Fact Tables
If you have cardinality between payments and disability tables:
```
Sum(Aggr(
    Only({<PAYMENT_ID>} PYMTAMT), 
    PAYMENT_ID
))
```

## Option 5: FirstValue for Cardinality Issues
```
Sum(Aggr(
    FirstValue(PYMTAMT), 
    PAYMENT_ID
))
```

## Option 6: Set Analysis to Break Associations
```
Sum({1<PAYMENT_ID = P(PAYMENT_ID)>} PYMTAMT)
```

## Option 7: Specific for NDIS Cardinality (Payment-Disability)
```
Sum(Aggr(
    Sum({<PAYMENT_ID, PARTICIPANT_KEY>} DISTINCT PYMTAMT), 
    PAYMENT_ID, 
    PARTICIPANT_KEY
))
```

## Option 8: Full Cardinality Control
```
Sum(Aggr(
    Only({<PAYMENT_ID, PARTICIPANT_KEY, NDISDSBLTYGRPNM>} PYMTAMT), 
    PAYMENT_ID
))
```

## Option 9: Alternative Fact Table Approach
If the issue is between fact tables:
```
Sum({<$Table={'PAYMENT_TABLE'}>} PYMTAMT)
```

## Diagnostic Expression to Check Cardinality:
Test with this to see the issue:
```
// Check if payment amounts are duplicating
Count(PYMTAMT) & ' records vs ' & 
Count(DISTINCT PYMTAMT) & ' distinct amounts'
```

## Most Common Solution for NDIS Data:
```
Sum(Aggr(
    Only(PYMTAMT), 
    PAYMENT_ID,
    PARTICIPANT_KEY
))
```

**The key is identifying your grain level** - usually PAYMENT_ID is unique, so aggregating at that level with `Only()` or `DISTINCT` will resolve cardinality multiplication.

Try **Option 2** first, then **Option 3** if you have a clear payment identifier that should be unique.
