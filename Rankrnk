Ah, I understand now! You want to rank by PMTRQSTPRVDRABN based on the grand total of all their payments across all service types and delivery statuses. Here's the corrected code:

## Method: Rank by Provider Grand Total Payment
```sql
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE RANKED_TRANSPOSED_DATA AS
    SELECT A.*,
           B.RANK
    FROM (
        SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
               LEGALNM,
               DELIVERY_ABN_STS,
               Service_Type,
               EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE,
               LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS,
               
               /* Payment columns by date */
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2023'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30SEP2023,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2023'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_31DEC2023,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30MAR2024,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30JUN2024,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30SEP2024,

               /* Count columns by date */
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2023'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30SEP2023,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2023'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_31DEC2023,

               /* Total columns */
               SUM(PAYMENT) AS TOTAL_PAYMENT,
               SUM(COUNT) AS TOTAL_COUNT
               
        FROM FINAL_DATA
        GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, LEGALNM, DELIVERY_ABN_STS, Service_Type, 
                 EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE, LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS
    ) AS A
    LEFT JOIN (
        /* Calculate grand total by PMTRQSTPRVDRABN and rank */
        SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
               RANK(GRAND_TOTAL_PAYMENT) AS RANK
        FROM (
            SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,

    ON A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
    ORDER BY B.RANK DESC, A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.Service_Type;
QUIT;
```

## Key Points:

1. **Provider 48163960192**: 
   - Grand Total = $100,162.01 + $170,181.90 + $1,722 = $271,865.91
   - **RANK: 1** (highest total)
   - All rows for this provider get RANK = 1

2. **Provider 48164106311**:
   - Grand Total = $41,275.62 + $25,550.22 = $66,825.84  
   - **RANK: 2** (second highest total)
   - All rows for this provider get RANK = 2

The ranking is now based on each provider's **grand total across all their service types and delivery statuses**, but each individual row still shows the breakdown by service type with the same rank applied to all rows for that provider.
