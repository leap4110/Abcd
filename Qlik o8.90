Looking at the original SAS code and your description of 1:1 relationships, I can identify several potential data accuracy issues that could cause percentages not to add up to 100%:

## **Primary Issue: Participant Data Mismatch**

### **1. Point-in-Time vs Historical Data Problem**
```sas
/* PAYMENTS DATA: Historical quarterly data */
FROM OUTBTD.BT_PMTS_DELIVERED&QTR.

/* PARTICIPANT DATA: Latest quarter only */
FROM OUTBTP.bt_participants&QTR.
WHERE EverEligblInd = 1;
```

**The Problem**: You're joining **historical payment data** with **current participant demographics**. A participant's age group in 2024-25 Q4 might be different from their age group when the payment was made in 2022-23 Q1.

### **2. Missing Participants**
Payments might exist for participants who are no longer in the latest participant table due to:
- Data retention policies
- Participant status changes
- System updates

## **Specific Issues in Age Breakdown:**

### **1. Orphaned Payments**
```sas
/* These payments won't match to any participant */
SELECT PAYMENT_KEY, PARTICIPANT_KEY 
FROM DIM_PAYMENT 
WHERE PARTICIPANT_KEY NOT IN (SELECT PARTICIPANT_KEY FROM DIM_PARTICIPANT)
```

### **2. Age Group Changes Over Time**
A participant who was "25-34" in 2023 might now be "35-44" in 2025, causing:
- Historical payments to show current age group
- Incorrect age distribution for historical periods

## **Solutions to Fix the Percentage Issue:**

### **Option 1: Capture Age at Time of Payment**
```sas
/* Add age group to the master table creation */
PROC SQL;
CREATE TABLE OUTPRVAP.MASTER_TABLE_&QTR. AS
SELECT 
    /* existing fields */
    p.AGE_GROUP_1 AS AGE_GROUP_AT_PAYMENT,
    p.PRIMARY_DISABILITY AS DISABILITY_AT_PAYMENT
FROM OUTBTD.BT_PMTS_DELIVERED&QTR. pay
LEFT JOIN OUTBTP.bt_participants&QTR. p 
    ON pay.PRSNWITHDSBLTYID = p.PRSNWITHDSBLTYID
WHERE /* existing conditions */;
```

### **Option 2: Use Participant Data from Same Quarter**
Instead of using only the latest participant data, use participant data from the same quarter as the payments:
```sas
%MACRO RETRIEVE_PIT (PERIOD_STRT, PERIOD_END, QTR, QTR2);
/* Use participant data from SAME quarter as payments */
PROC SQL; 
CREATE TABLE OUTPRVAP.ALL_PTC_&QTR. AS  
SELECT /* fields */
FROM OUTBTP.bt_participants&QTR.  /* Same quarter as payments */
WHERE EverEligblInd = 1;
```

### **Option 3: Data Quality Checks**
Add validation to identify the scope of the problem:
```sas
/* Check for orphaned payments */
PROC SQL;
CREATE TABLE ORPHANED_PAYMENTS AS
SELECT p.PARTICIPANT_KEY, COUNT(*) as PAYMENT_COUNT
FROM DIM_PAYMENT p
LEFT JOIN DIM_PARTICIPANT pt ON p.PARTICIPANT_KEY = pt.PARTICIPANT_KEY
WHERE pt.PARTICIPANT_KEY IS NULL
GROUP BY p.PARTICIPANT_KEY;

/* Check percentage of orphaned payments */
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN pt.PARTICIPANT_KEY IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100 as PCT_ORPHANED
FROM DIM_PAYMENT p
LEFT JOIN DIM_PARTICIPANT pt ON p.PARTICIPANT_KEY = pt.PARTICIPANT_KEY;
```

## **Immediate Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Check for NULL age groups** in your Qlik front-end
2. **Verify participant key matches** between payment and participant tables  
3. **Count total participants** vs **unique participants in payments**
4. **Check for missing participant records** for payment data

The root cause is likely that your historical payments contain participant keys that either don't exist in the current participant dimension or have changed demographic attributes since the payment occurred.
