Here's the revised text with improved grammar:

The market analytics team examines provider exits to support the branch, group, and division in policy work and in understanding the provider market across support services and demographics. There are two key time-critical pieces of work that require access to NDIA administrative data.

Key improvements made:
- Changed "examines provider exits to support the branch, group and division in policy work and understanding" to "examines provider exits to support the branch, group, and division in policy work and in understanding" (added serial comma and "in" for parallel structure)
- Changed "There are two key time-critical pieces of work which require" to "There are two key time-critical pieces of work that require" (used "that" instead of "which" for restrictive clause)
