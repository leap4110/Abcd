Ah, I understand! You want the actual DELIVERY_ABN_STS value (Registered/Unregistered) that corresponds to the maximum quarter for each provider. Here's the corrected code:

## Method 1: Using Subquery to Get Status at Max Quarter
```sql
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE FINAL_DATA AS
    SELECT *,
           /* Earliest registration date */
           MIN(CASE WHEN UPCASE(DELIVERY_ABN_STS) = 'REGISTERED' 
                    THEN REG_QUARTER2 
                    ELSE . END) AS EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE FORMAT=DATE9.,
           
           /* Delivery status at the latest quarter */
           (SELECT DELIVERY_ABN_STS 
            FROM TEMP99 AS B 
            WHERE B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN 
              AND B.QTR = (SELECT MAX(C.QTR) 
                          FROM TEMP99 AS C 
                          WHERE C.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN)
            LIMIT 1) AS LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS
    FROM TEMP99 AS A
    GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
    ORDER BY A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.QTR;
QUIT;
```

## Method 2: Two-Step Approach (Cleaner)
```sql
/* Step 1: Find the latest quarter and its delivery status for each provider */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE LATEST_STATUS_BY_PROVIDER AS
    SELECT A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
           A.QTR AS LATEST_QTR,
           A.DELIVERY_ABN_STS AS LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS,
           MIN(CASE WHEN UPCASE(B.DELIVERY_ABN_STS) = 'REGISTERED' 
                    THEN B.REG_QUARTER2 
                    ELSE . END) AS EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE FORMAT=DATE9.
    FROM TEMP99 AS A
         INNER JOIN (SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, MAX(QTR) AS MAX_QTR
                     FROM TEMP99 
                     GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN) AS MAX_QTRS
         ON A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = MAX_QTRS.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN 
            AND A.QTR = MAX_QTRS.MAX_QTR
         LEFT JOIN TEMP99 AS B ON A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
    GROUP BY A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.QTR, A.DELIVERY_ABN_STS;
QUIT;

/* Step 2: Join back to original data */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE FINAL_DATA AS
    SELECT A.*,
           B.EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE,
           B.LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS
    FROM TEMP99 AS A
         LEFT JOIN LATEST_STATUS_BY_PROVIDER AS B
         ON A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
    ORDER BY A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.QTR;
QUIT;
```

## Method 3: Using Window Functions (Most Efficient)
```sql
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE FINAL_DATA AS
    SELECT *,
           /* Earliest registration date */
           MIN(CASE WHEN UPCASE(DELIVERY_ABN_STS) = 'REGISTERED' 
                    THEN REG_QUARTER2 
                    ELSE . END) AS EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE FORMAT=DATE9.,
           
           /* Get delivery status where QTR equals the max QTR for that provider */
           MAX(CASE WHEN QTR = (SELECT MAX(QTR) FROM TEMP99 AS B WHERE B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN)
                   THEN DELIVERY_ABN_STS 
                   ELSE '' END) AS LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS
    FROM TEMP99 AS A
    GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
    ORDER BY A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.QTR;
QUIT;
```

## Method 4: Handling Multiple Records in Latest Quarter
```sql
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE FINAL_DATA AS
    SELECT A.*,
           B.EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE,
           B.LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS
    FROM TEMP99 AS A
         LEFT JOIN (
             SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
                    MIN(CASE WHEN UPCASE(DELIVERY_ABN_STS) = 'REGISTERED' 
                             THEN REG_QUARTER2 
                             ELSE . END) AS EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE FORMAT=DATE9.,
                    MAX(CASE WHEN QTR = MAX_QTR THEN DELIVERY_ABN_STS END) AS LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS
             FROM (SELECT *, 
                          MAX(QTR) OVER (PARTITION BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN) AS MAX_QTR
                   FROM TEMP99) AS INNER_QUERY
             GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
         ) AS B
         ON A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
    ORDER BY A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.QTR;
QUIT;
```

**I recommend Method 2** as it's the most readable and handles the logic clearly. 

Based on your data, this will give you:
- Provider 48163960192: LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS = "Registered" (because their latest quarter 2425_Q2 shows "Registered")
- Provider 48164106311: LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS = "Unregistered" (because their latest quarter shows "Unregistered")
- Provider 48164192214: LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS = "Unregistered" (because their latest quarter shows "Unregistered")

The key difference is that now you're getting the actual text value ("Registered" or "Unregistered") that exists in the DELIVERY_ABN_STS field for the record with the maximum QTR value for each provider.
