Here are several PROC SQL options to get distinct IDs for First Nations participants:

**To get the list of distinct First Nations IDs:**
```sas
proc sql;
    select distinct ID
    from your_dataset
    where abc = 1;
quit;
```

**To count the distinct First Nations participants:**
```sas
proc sql;
    select count(distinct ID) as distinct_first_nations_count
    from your_dataset
    where abc = 1;
quit;
```

**To get both the proportion and distinct count:**
```sas
proc sql;
    select 
        count(distinct case when abc = 1 then ID end) as first_nations_distinct_count,
        count(distinct ID) as total_distinct_count,
        calculated first_nations_distinct_count / calculated total_distinct_count as proportion format=percent8.2
    from your_dataset;
quit;
```

**To create a dataset with the distinct First Nations IDs:**
```sas
proc sql;
    create table first_nations_participants as
    select distinct ID
    from your_dataset
    where abc = 1;
quit;
```

Just remember to replace `your_dataset` with your actual dataset name and adjust the condition (`abc = 1`) if your First Nations indicator is coded differently.
