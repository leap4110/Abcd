Based on your description, you want to find the earliest registration date for each provider (PMTRQSTPRVDRABN). Here's the solution:

## Method 1: Using Window Function (Most Efficient)
```sql
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE TEMP_WITH_EARLIEST AS
    SELECT *,
           MIN(CASE WHEN UPCASE(DELIVERY_ABN_STS) = 'REGISTERED' 
                    THEN REG_QUARTER2 
                    ELSE . END) AS EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE FORMAT=DATE9.
    FROM TEMP99
    GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN;
QUIT;
```

## Method 2: Two-Step Approach with Join
```sql
/* Step 1: Calculate earliest registration date by provider */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE EARLIEST_REG_DATES AS
    SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
           MIN(REG_QUARTER2) AS EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE FORMAT=DATE9.
    FROM TEMP99
    WHERE UPCASE(DELIVERY_ABN_STS) = 'REGISTERED'
      AND REG_QUARTER2 IS NOT MISSING
    GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN;
QUIT;

/* Step 2: Join back to original data */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE FINAL_DATA AS
    SELECT A.*,
           COALESCE(B.EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE, .) AS EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE FORMAT=DATE9.
    FROM TEMP99 AS A
         LEFT JOIN EARLIEST_REG_DATES AS B
         ON A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
    ORDER BY A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.QTR;
QUIT;
```

## Method 3: Using Subquery in SELECT
```sql
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE FINAL_DATA AS
    SELECT *,
           (SELECT MIN(REG_QUARTER2)
            FROM TEMP99 AS B
            WHERE B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
              AND UPCASE(B.DELIVERY_ABN_STS) = 'REGISTERED'
              AND B.REG_QUARTER2 IS NOT MISSING) AS EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE FORMAT=DATE9.
    FROM TEMP99 AS A
    ORDER BY A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.QTR;
QUIT;
```

## Method 4: More Detailed with Validation
```sql
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE FINAL_DATA AS
    SELECT *,
           CASE 
             WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) 
                   FROM TEMP99 AS B 
                   WHERE B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN 
                     AND UPCASE(B.DELIVERY_ABN_STS) = 'REGISTERED') > 0 THEN
                 (SELECT MIN(REG_QUARTER2)
                  FROM TEMP99 AS B
                  WHERE B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
                    AND UPCASE(B.DELIVERY_ABN_STS) = 'REGISTERED'
                    AND B.REG_QUARTER2 IS NOT MISSING)
             ELSE .
           END AS EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE FORMAT=DATE9.
    FROM TEMP99 AS A
    ORDER BY A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.QTR;
QUIT;
```

## Method 5: Adding Additional Information
```sql
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE FINAL_DATA AS
    SELECT A.*,
           B.EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE,
           B.TOTAL_REG_PERIODS,
           B.EVER_REGISTERED
    FROM TEMP99 AS A
         LEFT JOIN (
             SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
                    MIN(REG_QUARTER2) AS EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE FORMAT=DATE9.,
                    COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_REG_PERIODS,
                    'YES' AS EVER_REGISTERED
             FROM TEMP99
             WHERE UPCASE(DELIVERY_ABN_STS) = 'REGISTERED'
               AND REG_QUARTER2 IS NOT MISSING
             GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
         ) AS B
         ON A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
    ORDER BY A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.QTR;
QUIT;
```

**I recommend Method 1** as it's the most efficient and clean. It will:

1. Look at each PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
2. Find all records where DELIVERY_ABN_STS = 'Registered'
3. Take the minimum (earliest) REG_QUARTER2 value from those records
4. Apply that same earliest date to ALL records for that provider

For example, looking at your data:
- Provider 48163960192: All records will get 30SEP2024 as the earliest registration date
- Provider 48164106311: All records will get missing (.) since this provider was never registered
- Provider 48164192214: All records will get missing (.) since this provider was never registered

This way, every record for the same provider will have the same EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE value, making it easy to identify when each provider first became registered.
