Here's the code to add a rank field based on highest TOTAL_PAYMENT using the RANK function:

## Method: Add Rank Based on Total Payment
```sql
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE RANKED_TRANSPOSED_DATA AS
    SELECT *,
           RANK(TOTAL_PAYMENT) AS RANK
    FROM (
        SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
               LEGALNM,
               DELIVERY_ABN_STS,
               Service_Type,
               EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE,
               LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS,
               
               /* Payment columns by date */
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2023'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30SEP2023,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2023'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_31DEC2023,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30MAR2024,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30JUN2024,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30SEP2024,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_31DEC2024,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2025'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30MAR2025,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2025'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30JUN2025,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC9999'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_31DEC9999,
               
               /* Count columns by date */
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2023'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30SEP2023,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2023'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_31DEC2023,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30MAR2024,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30JUN2024,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30SEP2024,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_31DEC2024,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2025'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30MAR2025,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2025'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30JUN2025,
               SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC9999'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_31DEC9999,
               
               /* Total columns */
               SUM(PAYMENT) AS TOTAL_PAYMENT,
               SUM(COUNT) AS TOTAL_COUNT
               
        FROM FINAL_DATA
        GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, LEGALNM, DELIVERY_ABN_STS, Service_Type, 
                 EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE, LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS
    ) AS TRANSPOSED_DATA
    ORDER BY CALCULATED RANK DESC, PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, Service_Type;
QUIT;
```

## Alternative: If you want ranking by PMTRQSTPRVDRABN level (not by each row)
```sql
/* Step 1: Create the transposed data */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE TRANSPOSED_DATA AS
    SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
           LEGALNM,
           DELIVERY_ABN_STS,
           Service_Type,
           EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE,
           LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS,
           
           /* Payment columns by date */
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2023'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30SEP2023,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2023'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_31DEC2023,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30MAR2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30JUN2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30SEP2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2024'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_31DEC2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2025'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30MAR2025,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2025'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_30JUN2025,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC9999'd THEN PAYMENT ELSE 0 END) AS PAYMENT_31DEC9999,
           
           /* Count columns by date */
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2023'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30SEP2023,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2023'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_31DEC2023,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30MAR2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30JUN2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30SEP2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30SEP2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC2024'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_31DEC2024,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30MAR2025'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30MAR2025,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '30JUN2025'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_30JUN2025,
           SUM(CASE WHEN REG_QUARTER2 = '31DEC9999'd THEN COUNT ELSE 0 END) AS COUNT_31DEC9999,
           
           /* Total columns */
           SUM(PAYMENT) AS TOTAL_PAYMENT,
           SUM(COUNT) AS TOTAL_COUNT
           
    FROM FINAL_DATA
    GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, LEGALNM, DELIVERY_ABN_STS, Service_Type, 
             EARLIEST_REGISTRATION_DATE, LATEST_DELIVERY_STATUS;
QUIT;

/* Step 2: Add provider-level ranking */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE RANKED_DATA AS
    SELECT A.*,
           B.PROVIDER_RANK AS RANK
    FROM TRANSPOSED_DATA AS A
         LEFT JOIN (
             SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
                    RANK(SUM(TOTAL_PAYMENT)) AS PROVIDER_RANK
             FROM TRANSPOSED_DATA
             GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
         ) AS B
         ON A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
    ORDER BY B.PROVIDER_RANK DESC, A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.Service_Type;
QUIT;
```

## Using PROC RANK (Alternative Approach)
```sas
/* Step 1: Create transposed data (same as above) */
/* ... transposed data creation code ... */

/* Step 2: Create provider totals for ranking */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE PROVIDER_TOTALS AS
    SELECT PMTRQSTPRVDRABN,
           SUM(TOTAL_PAYMENT) AS PROVIDER_TOTAL_PAYMENT
    FROM TRANSPOSED_DATA
    GROUP BY PMTRQSTPRVDRABN;
QUIT;

/* Step 3: Use PROC RANK */
PROC RANK DATA=PROVIDER_TOTALS 
          OUT=RANKED_PROVIDERS(RENAME=(PROVIDER_TOTAL_PAYMENT=RANKED_PAYMENT)) 
          DESCENDING;
    VAR PROVIDER_TOTAL_PAYMENT;
    RANKS RANK;
RUN;

/* Step 4: Join back to main data */
PROC SQL;
    CREATE TABLE FINAL_RANKED_DATA AS
    SELECT A.*,
           B.RANK
    FROM TRANSPOSED_DATA AS A
         LEFT JOIN RANKED_PROVIDERS AS B
         ON A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN = B.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN
    ORDER BY B.RANK, A.PMTRQSTPRVDRABN, A.Service_Type;
QUIT;
```

**I recommend the first method** as it's most straightforward. The RANK function will give you:
- **Rank 1** = Highest total payment
- **Rank 2** = Second highest total payment  
- And so on...

The `DESCENDING` in the ORDER BY ensures the highest-ranked providers appear first in your results.
